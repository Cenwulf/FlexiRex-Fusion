In addition to the parameters included with the base [FlexiRex-Fusion.f3d](../FlexiRex-Fusion.f3d) and detailed in the [README](../README.md?tab=readme-ov-file#fusion-parameter-reference), the [FlexiRex-Earrings.f3d](FlexiRex-Earrings.f3d) file has additional geometry modelled to accommodate blank earrings studs and silicone bullet style fasteners. In addition to the parameters included with the base [FlexiRex-Fusion.f3d](../FlexiRex-Fusion.f3d), the FlexiRex-Earrings.f3d file includes parameters that allow you to adjust the dimensions of the earring hardware geometry.

### Parameters

#### earring_blank_diameter

Diameter of the blank earring plate. When measuring, allow some clearance for a good fit with the printed part. Depending on printer, +0.1 mm is usually a good starting point.

#### earring_blank_thickness

Thickness of the blank earring plate. Again, when measuring, allow some clearance for a good fit with the printed part.

#### earring_pin_diameter

Diameter of the post of the earring stud. Again, when measuring, allow some clearance for a good fit with the printed part.

#### earring_bullet_diameter

Diameter of the silicone bullet fixing. When measuring, subtract at least 0.1 mm from the measured value to allow for a good tight fit of the relatively soft silicone fixing.
